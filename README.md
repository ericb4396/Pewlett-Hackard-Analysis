# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The overall purpose of the project was to help Pewlett-Hackard analyze their "sliver tsunami" that will be happening in their workforce soon.
To do this we had to look at and identify the number of retiring employees as well as identify the number of their employees who would be eligible to be part of their mentor program they have.

## Results
- There is a large amount of retirees with Pewlett-Hackard with 133,776 employees fitting into their retirement criteria being born from 1/1/1952 to 12/31/1955.
- Withing the given requirements of their employee being born between 1/1/1965 and 12/31/1965 for their mentorship program their are currently only 1,549 people eligible for the program.
- They will be losing 57,668 senior employees and 26,465 employees within those retirement constraints.
- I believe the biggest loss however will be the 2 Managers being lost as those are much harder to train and get correct to keep the company moving.

## Summary
I did analysis and expanded the requirements on both the retirement criteria and the mentorship program. There is 90,398 positions that will need to be filled with the original set of requirements being from 1/1/1952 to 12/31/1955. I however added two years to the end of the requirements for the workers who retire early and the numbers jumped to 136,299 employees. This shows that there is a major need for new workers.
I belive they will have enough mentors within thier company with 1,549 mentors fitting the requirement of being born in the year 1965. I expanded the criteria to be born between 1965 and 1967 and it will definitely help with keeping the company from having a major setback with the silver tsunami coming.
